# CarRental
Web application to rent cars
The backend consists of the folders: api, backend, and myapp.
The manage.py file manages the django backend.
To install the requirements for the backend just run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt after setting up a virtual env

To run the localserver for the backend: python manage.py runserver



To install frontend dependencies go to the car-app folder and :npm install 
and to run the frontend: npm run dev


Need to run both of these in separate terminal instances.
